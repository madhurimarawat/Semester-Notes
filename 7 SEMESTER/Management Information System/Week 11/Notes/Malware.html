Brief: This table outlines common cybersecurity threats, their definitions, examples, and key properties. 
It provides a quick reference to understand different types of cyber threats and how they can impact systems 
and users, including viruses, spyware, ransomware, and phishing.

Additional Details:
- Color Palette: The table uses a light pastel color scheme with alternating shades such as lavender, coral, 
  cyan, and light teal for different rows, ensuring the table is easy to read and visually appealing.
- Emoji Usage: Each threat type is paired with a relevant emoji (e.g., 🦠 for Virus, 🛠️ for Rootkit, 🎣 for Phishing), 
  enhancing the visual representation and making the content more engaging.
- Design: The table is designed for clarity, with each row colored differently for easy differentiation. 
  The headers use a contrasting color to stand out and maintain a cohesive design.
- Purpose: The goal of this table is to educate users about various cybersecurity threats, the characteristics of 
  each, and examples of well-known threats that have posed security risks in the past. This information is valuable 
  for individuals and organizations looking to strengthen their cybersecurity knowledge and practices.
