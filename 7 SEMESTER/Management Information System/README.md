## Additional Tables and Visuals

To enhance the understanding of key concepts, I have created **colorful, intuitive HTML tables** enriched with emojis ðŸŽ¨âœ¨. These visuals complement the weekly notes and bring clarity to complex ideas. Below are some examples from specific weeks:

### Week 7: Delivery Models
