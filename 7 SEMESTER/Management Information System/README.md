## Lecture Notes

These notes were carefully crafted to condense and simplify the core content of each week. They include:

- Summarized concepts and frameworks
- Business models and real-world applications
- Custom visuals that aid learning and recall

The notes reflect a learner’s perspective and aim to make MIS easier to grasp, whether you're revising or exploring the subject for the first time.
