## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 1. 🎯 Nash Equilibrium

A situation in a game where no player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged.

### 2. 🧮 Dominant Strategies

A strategy that always provides a better outcome for a player, no matter what the opponents do.

### 3. 🌱 Pareto Optimality

An allocation is Pareto optimal if no individual can be made better off without making someone else worse off.

### 4. 💸 Price of Anarchy (PoA)

A measure of how the efficiency of a system degrades due to selfish behavior of its agents.

### 5. 🧾 Mechanism Design

A field that designs rules of a game to achieve a specific outcome, even when players act in their self-interest.

### 6. ⚖️ Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) Mechanism

A type of auction mechanism that encourages truthful bidding and maximizes social welfare.

### 7. 🤝 Social Welfare

The sum of all players’ utilities in a game. Often used as a benchmark to measure the outcome efficiency.

### 8. 🛍️ Auctions

Various formats like First-price, Second-price (Vickrey), and English auctions used to allocate resources or goods.

### 9. 🔗 Matching Markets

Markets where individuals or entities are paired based on preferences, like students to colleges or organ donors to recipients.

### 10. 💍 Stable Marriage Problem

A classic problem where pairs are matched without any two people preferring each other over their assigned partners.

### 11. 🤔 Bayesian Games

Games where players have incomplete information and must reason about the types and beliefs of others.

### 12. ⚔️ Zero-sum Games

Games where one player’s gain is exactly another player’s loss—commonly used in competitive scenarios.

### 13. 📉 Minimax Theorem

Used in zero-sum games to determine strategies that minimize the possible maximum loss (worst-case scenario).

### 14. 🔁 Repeated Games

Games that are played more than once, allowing strategies to evolve over time with learning and trust.

### 15. 🧩 Extensive Form Games

Games represented using trees that show sequential moves, choices, and payoffs, like in chess or bargaining.
