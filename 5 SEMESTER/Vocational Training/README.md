<h2>Pycharm</h2>

- Visit the official website of pycharm: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/"><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.c936445e15a65dfdba20a63e14e7df39?rik=fqWqO9kKIVlK7g&riu=http%3a%2f%2fassets.stickpng.com%2fimages%2f58481537cef1014c0b5e4968.png&ehk=dtrTKn1QsJ3%2b2TFlSfLR%2fxHdNYHdrqqCUUs8voipcI8%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" title="PyCharm" alt="PyCharm" width="40" height="40"></a><br><br>
- Download according to the platform that will be used like Linux, Macos or Windows.<br><br>
- Two versions of Pycharm are avilable-

1. Community version <br><br>

- Community version is open source and we can use it for free without any paid plan.<br><br>
- We can download this at the end of pycharm website.<br><br>
- After downloading community version we can directly follow the setup wizard and it will be setup.<br><br>

2.  Professional Version.<br><br>

- This is available at the top of website, we can directly download from there.<br><br>
- After downloading professional version, follow the below steps.<br><br>
- Follow the setup wizard and sign up for the free version (trial version) or else continue with the premium or paid version.<br>

### Using Pycharm

- First, in pycharm we have the concept of virtual environment. In virtual environment we can install all the required libraries or frameworks.<br><br>
- Each project has its own virtual environment, so thath we can install requirements like Libraries or Framworks for that project only.<br><br>
- After this we can create a new file, various file types are available in pycharm like script files, text files and also Jupyter Notebooks.<br><br>
- After selecting the required file type, we can continue the execution of that file by saving it and using this shortcut shift+F10 (In Windows).<br><br>
- Output is given in Console while installation happens in terminal in Pycharm.

## Streamlit Server

- Streamlit is a python framework through which we can deploy any machine learning model and any python project with ease and without worrying about the frontend.<br><br>
- Streamlit is very user-friendly.<br><br>
- Streamlit has pre defined functions for all frontend components and we can directly use them.<br><br>
- To install streamlit in your system, just run this command-

```
pip install streamlit
```

## Running Project in Streamlit Server

<p>Make Sure all dependencies are already satisfied before running the app.</p>

1. We can Directly run streamlit app with the following command-<br>

```
streamlit run app.py
```

where app.py is the name of file containing streamlit code.<br>

By default, streamlit will run on port 8501.<br>

Also we can execute multiple files simultaneously and it will be executed in next ports like 8502 and so on.<br>

2. Navigate to URL http://localhost:8501

You should be able to view the homepage of your app.

🌟 Project and Models will change but this process will remain the same for all Streamlit projects.<br>

## Deploying using Streamlit

1. Visit the official website of streamlit : <a href="https://streamlit.io/"><img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/S/streamlit-logo-1A3B208AE4-seeklogo.com.png" title="Streamlit" alt="Streamlit" width="40" height="40"></a> <br><br>
2. Now make an account with GitHub.<br><br>
3. Now add all the code in Github repository.<br><br>
4. Go to streamlit and there is an option for new deployment.<br><br>
5. Type your Github repository name and specify the file name. If you name your file as streamlit_app it will directly access it else you have to specify the path.<br><br>
6. Now also make sure you upload all your libraries and requirement name in a requirement.txt file.<br><br>
7. Version can also be mentioned like this python==3.9.<br><br>
8. When we mention version in the requirement file streamlit install all dependencies from there.<br><br>
9. If everything went well our app will be deployed on web and you can share the link and access the app from all browsers.

## About Project :

<p>Complete Description about the project and resources used.</p>

- In this project I made a streamlit website in which you can apply multiple supervised learning algorithm on Credit Card Fruad dataset.<br><br>
- I also did Data Visualization to show the working of this algorithms on the dataset.<br><br>
- I have deployed this website using streamlit.<br><br>
- Visit Website from : <a href="https://final-internship-project-nvdx7l2pqe42g2p9ambd8s.streamlit.app/">ML Algorithms on Credit Card Dataset</a>

## Algorithm Used :

<h2>Supervised Learning</h2>

- Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well-labelled. <br><br>
- Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer.<br><br>
- After that, the machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labeled data.<br><br>

<h3>i) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) </h3>
<br>

- K-Nearest Neighbours is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in Machine Learning.<br><br>
- It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining, and intrusion detection..<br><br>
- In this algorithm,we identify category based on neighbors.<br><br>

<h3>ii) Support Vector Machines (SVM) </h3>
<br>

- The main idea behind SVMs is to find a hyperplane that maximally separates the different classes in the training data. <br><br>
- This is done by finding the hyperplane that has the largest margin, which is defined as the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. <br><br>
- Once the hyperplane is determined, new data can be classified by determining on which side of the hyperplane it falls. <br><br>
- SVMs are particularly useful when the data has many features, and/or when there is a clear margin of separation in the data.<br><br>

<h3>iii) Naive Bayes Classifiers</h3>
<br>

- Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. <br><br>
- It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.<br><br>
- The fundamental Naive Bayes assumption is that each feature makes an independent and equal contribution to the outcome.<br><br>

<h3>iv) Decision Tree</h3>
<br>

- It builds a flowchart-like tree structure where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label.<br><br>
- It is constructed by recursively splitting the training data into subsets based on the values of the attributes until a stopping criterion is met, such as the maximum depth of the tree or the minimum number of samples required to split a node.<br><br>
- The goal is to find the attribute that maximizes the information gain or the reduction in impurity after the split.<br><br>

<h3>v) Random Forest</h3>
<br>

- It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.<br><br>
- Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions, and it predicts the final output.<br><br>
- The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.<br><br>

<h3>vi) Logistic Regression</h3>
<br>

- Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance of belonging to a given class or not. <br><br>
- It is a kind of statistical algorithm, which analyze the relationship between a set of independent variables and the dependent binary variables. <br><br>
- It is a powerful tool for decision-making.<br><br>
- For example email spam or not. <br>
