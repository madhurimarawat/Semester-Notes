<details>
  <summary>docs</summary> <br>
  
  This folder contains the code for this website:
  
  - The `index.html` file serves as the main page.
  - The website is user-friendly, featuring an intuitive interface that is easy to navigate.
  - Responsive design ensures the website looks great and functions well on all devices and screen sizes.
  - A dropdown menu allows dynamic color changes with options for Autumn, Summer, Rainy, and Winter. Upon selection, the website color changes instantly. Refreshing the page restores the default color scheme.

### Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Subjects

During the **1st to 4th semesters**, both branches followed a **common curriculum**, ensuring a foundational understanding of core subjects. 

From the **5th to 7th semesters**, the curriculum began to diversify:  
- **5th and 7th semesters:** Two subjects were tailored to individual tracks, reflecting specialized interests. I have detailed these differences above, along with separate **question papers** and **syllabi** for both branches (AI and DS).  
- **6th semester:** Focused entirely on an **internship**, where students selected their projects, institutions, and domains independently.
