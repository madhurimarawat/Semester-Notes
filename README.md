### Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Subjects

During the **1st to 4th semesters**, both branches followed a **common curriculum**, ensuring a foundational understanding of core subjects. 

From the **5th to 7th semesters**, the curriculum began to diversify:  
- **5th and 7th semesters:** Two subjects were tailored to individual tracks, reflecting specialized interests. I have detailed these differences above, along with separate **question papers** and **syllabi** for both branches (AI and DS).  
- **6th semester:** Focused entirely on an **internship**, where students selected their projects, institutions, and domains independently.
